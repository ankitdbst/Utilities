Tic Tac Toe
-------------
The traditional Tic Tac Toe game in python by implementing a game tree.

Ternary Search Tree
-------------------
This is a form of a trie (retrieval) data structure which is 
space efficient than a normal trie and is useful for prefix string
searches. eg. Output results from the prefix string typed by the user

Bloom Filters
-------------
This is the space efficient probabilistic data structure to test whether an
element is in the set. Used in spell checking.
From a list of dictionaries it can return whether  

Priority Queues
---------------
Priority queues using heap as the underlying data strucure. Ascending and 
descending priority queue implementation using min/max heap. Uses dynamic memory allocation as opposed to an array like implementation.

Binary Search Trees
-------------------
Class to implement BST searches and insertions
